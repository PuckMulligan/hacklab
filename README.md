# hacklab v. 0.0.1

This is a demo version of an ethical hacker/pentesting training environment based on Hack the Box and TryHackMe. This is a modular FOSS scenario manager.

The manager will allow you to set up in console a loaded VM that's configured with a security flaw and a target flag.

Plans to add:
- more scenarios
- victory condition check
- better UI
