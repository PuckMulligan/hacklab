Scenario: FTP Misconfiguration

Welcome to the "FTP Misconfiguration" scenario. Your task is to exploit a misconfigured FTP server to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files.

Scenario Steps:
1. FTP Enumeration:
   - Discover the IP address of the target FTP server.

2. FTP Service Scanning:
   - Connect to the FTP server (anonymous login or with basic credentials).
   - List the files and directories available on the server.

3. File Enumeration:
   - Identify a file or directory that should not be publicly accessible.

4. Misconfiguration Discovery:
   - Determine the nature of the misconfiguration that allows access to sensitive files.

5. Exploitation:
   - Attempt to download or modify the sensitive file or directory.

6. Capture the Flag (Optional):
   - As an optional challenge, locate and retrieve a specific file ("flag") within the sensitive directory to demonstrate your success.

Important Notes:
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to attempt these actions.
- Please use this scenario for educational purposes only.

Happy hacking!
